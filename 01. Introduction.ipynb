    "- However, there are often more concise ways to specify the desired set of strings. <br>For example, the set `{file, file1, file2}` can be specified by the pattern `file(1|2)?`. <br>We say that this pattern matches each of the three strings. [Wanna check?](https://regexr.com/48om5)\n",

    "\n",
    "> *The story begins with a neuroscientist and a logician who together tried to understand how the human brain could produce complex patterns using simple cells that are bound together.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1943, neurophysiologists ***Warren McCulloch*** and ***Walter Pitts*** published ***\"A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity\"***. This paper not only represented the beginning of the regular expressions, but also proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1956, ***Stephen Kleene*** wrote the paper ***\"Representation of events in nerve nets and finite automata\"***, where he coined the terms **regular sets** and **regular expressions** and presented a simple algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1968, the Unix pioneer ***Ken Thompson***  took Kleene's work and extended it, publishing his studies in the paper ***\"Regular Expression Search Algorithm\"***. Ken Thompson's work didn't end in just writing a paper. He also implemented Kleene’s notation in the editor ***QED***. The aim was that the user could do advanced pattern matching in text files. The same feature appeared later on in the editor ***ed***.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To search for a Regular Expression in ed you wrote `g/<regular expression>/p` The letter g meant global search and p meant print the result. The command — `g/re/p` — resulted in the standalone program grep, released in the fourth edition of Unix 1973.<br><span style=\"color:red;\">However, **grep** didn’t have a complete implementation of regular expressions.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1979, ***Alfred Aho*** developed ***egrep (extended grep)*** in the seventh edition of Unix. The program egrep translated any regular expressions to a corresponding [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1987, ***Larry Wall*** created the scripting language ***Perl***. Regular Expressions are seamlessly integrated in Perl, even with its own literals. Hence, Perl pushed the regular expressions to the mainstream. The implementation in Perl went forward and added many modifications to the original regular expression syntax, creating the so-called ***Perl flavor***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some other worth mentioning milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IEEE thought their POSIX standard has tried to standardize and give better Unicode support to the regular expression syntax and behaviors. This is called the ***POSIX flavor*** of the regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In late 1980s, ***Henry Spencer*** wrote ***\"regex\"***, a widely used software library for regular expressions in C programming langauge.\n",

    "- It was the rise of the web that gave a big boost to the Perl implementation of regex, and that's where we get the modern syntax of regular expressions today; it really comes from Perl. `Apache`, `C`, `C++`, `the .NET languages`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `MySQL`, `PHP`, `Python`, `Ruby` all of these are endeavoring to be Perl-compatible languages and programs. There's also a library called the `PCRE` library that stands for Perl-Compatible Regular Expression library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Today, the standard Python module for regular expressions—`re`—supports only Perl-style regular expressions. There is an [effort](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex) to write a new regex module with better POSIX style support. This new module is intended to replace Python's `re` module implementation eventually. "
